A high-frequency MQL5 Expert Advisor specialized for the EURUSD pair, designed to generate hundreds of trades per year using multiple scalping strategies.

## Overview

VolatilityForce v0.2 is a comprehensive scalping system that combines multiple trading strategies to identify frequent trading opportunities. The system uses volatility measurements, momentum indicators, breakout patterns, and range-bound conditions to enter trades with tight risk parameters.

   - Confirms with price position relative to SMA
   - Implements momentum acceleration rules

3. **Range-Bound Strategy**: Exploits mean reversion in consolidating markets
